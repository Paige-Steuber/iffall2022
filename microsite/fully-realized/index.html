                <b>Glassblowing</b> is a glassforming technique that involves inflating molten glass into a bubble (or
                parison)
                with the aid of a blowpipe (or blow tube). A person who blows glass is called a glassblower, glassmith,
                or
                gaffer. A lampworker (often also called a glassblower or glassworker) manipulates glass with the use of
                a
                torch on a smaller scale, such as in producing precision laboratory glassware out of borosilicate glass.

            <p>

                The major tools used by a glassblower are the blowpipe (or blow tube), punty (or punty rod, pontil, or
                mandrel), bench, marver, blocks, jacks, paddles, tweezers, newspaper pads, and a variety of shears.
            </p>

                    <p>
                        Blowpipe
                        The tip of the blowpipe is first preheated; then dipped in the molten glass in the furnace. The
                        molten
                        glass
                        is "gathered" onto the end of the blowpipe in much the same way that viscous honey is picked up
                        on a
                        honey
                        dipper. This glass is then rolled on the marver, which was traditionally a flat slab of marble,
                        but
                        today is
                        more commonly a fairly thick flat sheet of steel. This process, called "marvering",[17] forms a
                        cool
                        skin on
                        the exterior of the molten glass blob, and shapes it. Then air is blown into the pipe, creating
                        a
                        bubble.
                        Next, the glassworker can gather more glass over that bubble to create a larger piece. Once a
                        piece
                        has
                        been
                        blown to its approximate final size, the bottom is finalized. Then, the molten glass is attached
                        to
                        a
                        stainless steel or iron rod called a "punty" for shaping and transferring the hollow piece from
                        the
                        blowpipe
                        to provide an opening and to finalize the top.

                        Blocks
                        Blocks are ladle-like tools made from water-soaked fruitwood, and are used similarly to the
                        marver
                        to

                        15 cm (6 in) square, 1.3 to 2.5 centimetres (0.5 to 1 in) thick), held in the bare hand, can be
                        used
                        to
                        shape the piece.

                        handheld
                        tools, and two rails that the pipe or punty rides on while the blower works with the piece.

                        Jacks
                        Jacks are tools shaped somewhat like large tweezers with two blades, which are used for forming
                        shape

                        such
                        as
                        a bottom. Tweezers are used to pick out details or to pull on the glass. There are two important
                        types
                        of
                        shears, straight shears and diamond shears. Straight shears are essentially bulky scissors, used
                        for
                        making
                        linear cuts. Diamond shears have blades that form a diamond shape when partially open. These are
                        used
                        for
                        cutting off masses of glass.

            <h1>History</h1>
            <p>
                Earliest evidence
                Glassblowing was invented by Syrian craftsmen from Sidon and Babylon between 27 BC and 14 AD. The
                ancient
                Romans copied the technique consisting of blowing air into molten glass with a blowpipe making it into a
                bubble.
                Hence, tube blowing not only represents the initial attempts of experimentation by glassworkers at
                blowing
                glass, it is also a revolutionary step that induced a change in conception and a deep understanding of
                glass. Such inventions swiftly eclipsed all other traditional methods, such as casting and core-forming,
                in
                working glass.

                Roman Empire
                The invention of glassblowing coincided with the establishment of the Roman Empire in the 1st century
                BC,
                which enhanced the spread and dominance of this new technology. Glassblowing was greatly supported by
                the
                Roman government (although Roman citizens could not be "in trade", in particular under the reign of
                Augustus), and glass was being blown in many areas of the Roman world. On the eastern borders of the
                Empire,
                the first large glass workshops were set up by the Phoenicians in the birthplace of glassblowing in
                contemporary Lebanon and Israel as well as in the neighbouring province of Cyprus

                Middle Ages
                The glass blowing tradition was carried on in Europe from the medieval period through the Middle Ages to
                the
                Renaissance in the demise of the Roman Empire in the 5th century AD. During the early medieval period,
                the
                Franks manipulated the technique of glassblowing by creating the simple corrugated molds and developing
                the
                claws decoration techniques. Blown glass objects, such as the drinking vessels that imitated the shape
                of
                the animal horn were produced in the Rhine and Meuse valleys, as well as in Belgium. The Byzantine
                glassworkers made mold-blown glass decorated with Christian and Jewish symbols in Jerusalem between the
                late
                6th century and the middle of the 7th century AD. Mold-blown vessels with facets, relief and linear-cut
                decoration were discovered at Samarra in the Islamic lands.

                Recent developments
                The "studio glass movement" began in 1962 when Harvey Littleton, a ceramics professor, and Dominick
                Labino,
                a chemist and engineer, held two workshops at the Toledo Museum of Art, during which they started
                experimenting with melting glass in a small furnace and creating blown glass art. Littleton promoted the
                use
                of small furnaces in individual artists studios.This approach to glassblowing blossomed into a worldwide
                movement, producing such flamboyant and prolific artists as Dale Chihuly, Dante Marioni, Fritz Driesbach
                and
                Marvin Lipofsky as well as scores of other modern glass artists. Today there are many different
                institutions
                around the world that offer glassmaking resources for training and sharing equipment.
