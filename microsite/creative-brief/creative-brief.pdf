Project Title: Women in Computing
1. Project overview
The goal of my website is to be generally informational and to provide some history and context in the world of computer sciece.
2. Resources
Most of the information can be found here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_computing, as well as some other historic resources.
4. Audience
This is a strictly informational site, and won’t be promoted commercially in any way. This will be
a part of my portfolio though, so it’s likely that my instructors will see and review it. It’s also likely
that prospective employers will see it. Demographic information could be all across the board,
but the audience won’t likely include children, or people of higher than retirement age.
5. Message
I would love to showcase the overlooked impact of women in computer science. I want the site to be engaging to the viewer 
so that they want to learn more as much as I do.
6. Tone
The tone here I think should be engaging and interesting. I dont think fun has to be taken off the table.
I think there are a lot of avenues that the site could be made into something exciting and not just a 
monotone recount of the history.
8. Visual Style
My first thought on the visual stylke would be a hybrid of new tech aesthetic with a more historic undertone. Tech-y but not overbearing.
