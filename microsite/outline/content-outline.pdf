Project Title: Women in Computing
I’d like to build this site as multiple pages, rather than a long, single page website. Typical site
navigation probably across the top. I think there is plenty of content and photography to build
out individual pages. I think it might be interesting to break the eras (1700s, 1800s...) across different pages.
 Home Page/Introduction – Introduce basic point I want to get across about Women in Computing. Set the tone for their overlooked impact.
 the era pages
 information about the gender gap
 organizations
 Sources – this page will just list sources, including the Wikipedia page, as well as other
sources for photography, and any other credits that need to be provided.
