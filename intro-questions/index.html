                I am very interested in dynamic design and interaction design and taking an interaction foundations class seems like a good place to nurture that curiosity.

                Yes, i have taken the engineering class Intro to Web Developement and I have made many sites with html and css.

                I hope to develop my process a bit more. At the moment I kind of just throw myself into the site and hope for the best. I wish to gain more practice planning and developing my ideas before trying to figure them out on the screen.

                One thing I know is different is the responsive changes to size that my designs need to be able to handle.

                I think the <a href="https://digital-cover.com/">digital cover site</a> does a really good job of making the user want to scroll through the whole site. The dynamic animations and movement is very eye catching.

                I think the <a href="https://swabtheworld.com/en/">swab the world site</a> presents all of the important information very clearly while staying dynamic and interesting.
            </li>

                I think the <a href="https://www.mubasic.com/">mubasic</a> works very nicely as a beatiful site targeted specifically at their user base.
