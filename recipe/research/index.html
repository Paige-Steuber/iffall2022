        <h1>Recipe Websites</h1>
        <p> On <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/">Allrecipes</a> I like the use of checkboxes beside the ingredients. I think it offers a nice little interaction. I also like how quickly you see the reviews on the recipes, immediately you know if the recipe is a hit or not. There are some arrangement things i find awkward, for example on <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/6865/to-die-for-blueberry-muffins/">this blueberry muffin recipe</a> the video of the top jumps to the bottom right corner when you scroll and, while I like the idea, the pacement feels awkward and out of place - especially when it interacts with things already on the sidebar.</p>       
        <p> <a href="https://www.simplyrecipes.com/"> Simply Recipes </a>, I think the landing page for Simply Recipes is really effective. A nice spotlight recipe with similar dishes scrolling to the left really builds an appetite and makes for alluring calls to action. Then how the categories are laid out after that is really effective as well. </p>
        <p> I like how modern <a href="https://www.bonappetit.com/recipes"> Bon Appetit's </a> pages are. The simple black and white complemented by the images makes a sharp apperence. I do wish the header bar wasn't so pronounced when you're looking at the actual recipe.</p>

        <h1> Non-recipe</h1>
        <p> I think the way<a href="https://homesociete.ca/en/"> Home Societe </a> handles their content is really interesting. There's many different elements that they needed to communicate and the layout that they have now works well to make consuming the information not overwhelming. I also like the side scroll, thats always fun </p>
        <p> <a href="https://www.theoceanagency.org/"> The Ocean Agency's website </a>  has a very clear breakdown of information that needs to be communicated. The clear distinctions between sections and the clear nav elements makes this site both beautiful and easy to navigate.</p>
        <p> I like how <a href="https://www.skylinefilms.tv/"> Skyline Films' website </a> almost forces the viewer to interact with all of the content on the site with auto redirects with almost seamless transitions. </p>
